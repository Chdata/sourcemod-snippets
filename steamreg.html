<p>Register a Steam server account</p>
<p>Although there are entries for Left 4 Dead 2 and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, these games do not yet support sv_setsteamaccount.</p>

<form action="https://api.steampowered.com/IGameServersService/CreateAccount/v0001/" method="POST">
<p>Game: <select name="appid">
<option value="440" selected="selected">Team Fortress 2</option>
<option value="240">Counter-Strike: Source</option>
<option value="300">Day of Defeat: Source</option>
<option value="320">Half-Life 2: Deathmatch</option>

<h2>Usage instructions:</h2>

<p>If your API key was valid and you have less than 50 servers registered to this API key, you will get back a JSON response that contains a login_token. <strong>Each server you own needs its own login_token.</strong>  I will refer to the value of the login token as <em>login_tokenvalue</em></p>

<p>For Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike: Source, Day of Defeat: Source, and Half-Life 2: Deathmatch: Add <code>sv_setsteamaccount <em>login_tokenvalue</em></code> to your autoexec.cfg or some other config file that runs on server startup, or <code>+sv_setsteamaccount <em>login_tokenvalue</em></code> to your startup line.  <strong>Adding this to server.cfg does not work as it executes too late.</strong></p>

<p>For other Source games, you can use SourceMod <a target="_blank" href="https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=237481">Set Game Server Account plugin</a> (opens in new window).  Note that it depends on the SteamWorks extension, which must also be installed.  Once the plugin is installed, put your <em>login_tokenvalue</em> into the addons/sourcemod/configs/gameserveraccount_token.txt file.</p>

<p>As far as I know, there are no AMXModX plugins to get this working with GoldSrc games.</p>
